I'm Adolfo, a computer engineer <a href="/exams/" style="text-decoration: none; background-color: var(--code-bg); color: var(--primary); padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;"><em>wannabe.</em></a>
On this site you'll find my projects, the books I read, and the movies I've recently watched.
So, not just a portfolio site but a hybrid space where you can understand what I like to do in the various contexts that occupy my life: work, culture, sports (this last section will arrive soon).
The site is simple and essential, without unnecessary complications, modular, and easily updatable, all thanks to an efficient mix of <a href="/projects/aboutsite" style="color: var(--primary); font-weight: bold;">Hugo & Papermod</a>.
For any curiosity, project proposal, or exchange of ideas, don't hesitate to <a href="/en/contacts" style="color: var(--primary); font-weight: bold;">contact me!</a> (I swear I even check the spam folder)
