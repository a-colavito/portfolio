# Map libraries

This project concerns the view of the maps of the libraries of __protted_item_55_1176766912C84D538A2F9A2B997FB0BD_, using the maps of __proted_item_13_C93FB784E38B4E05AD656A4E710C7410__ JavaScript __Protted_item_14_b0d2351be50d4888B6AB711CE0613181__.

## Project structure

The entire project is contained in the __protcted_item_15_6234645F2147F78350A1DB2FC8BDDFF__, which includes HTML files for the four maps of libraries of __ Protected_item_56_D11E7A8F75A84D4FB3BD963CEC5AE76E__. Within this folder, there are three other subcarters:

- __protcted_item_16_7142e1d04a1446bea6c0b8cffa3c467e
- __protedTed_item_17_351f3f7d7c0a47e2a7a409e3308e4f0d__
- __protcted_item_18_F0B69B663A70437A8BD2A1914567D6E__

### folder __protcted_item_19_b8b26ed4c5a446ddab45350189763A66__

This folder contains the subcartella __protted_item_20_6d8E190E36D347E1939B045D8D8B2D7A55__, which in turn includes JS files with variables (named the file) to initialize the data __Protted_item_21_D919107F42CD4E7CA0632C16E4382120_ All data on points, polygons, resources and paths are extracted from these files.

### folder __protted_item_22_bb39d61d159c4b3584bd91ad73726a83__

The __proted_item_23_60C550E981504F008CD8D361208ECF3333333333333 The main features of this file include:

- __protted_item_25_edb6f60c5c5b954c74a8adb51ABE430DBA_: a function that accepts parameters such as `cencoordinates`,` zoomlevel`, etc., to set the layers of __ProtedTed_item_47_E330B78873B44567BD830FBAE7B462CC__ and determine how the library is represented on the map and in the drop -down menu.
- __protted_item_26_6ABC90AFE2EE448F9E0EEEAE87C15D67C__ to the map.
- __protedTed_item_27_DEC9312761044E85B63C8EBF9C29439__: allows you to toge the menu and initialize the routes, showing the information relating to the library.
- __protted_item_28_a4ae18EB111345A592D47F8982F38658__: extends the __proted_item_48_CB46983E541743C7A2A7B7D4DEA8A62____TEMS.

The manufacturer function simplifies the initialization of the map, allowing you to insert customizations through parameters passed to the __proted_item_29_22ce18B4A81D433DBF06D8F8D9A9AEE4B____ function This approach makes the HTML code more slender and facilitates the addition of new resources by simply recalling the script in the HTML file of the new resource.

### folder __protcted_item_30_9f8Ca0AB7A2A47A1BE32AB9DB42F89D7__

The __proted_item_31_c6CB42EC52B6452A9D727144B228F4BF__ Folder contains the file __proted_item_32_8339622222222222222222222A23047A238338FB_, which manages the aspect of the menu of the maps and implement the class and implement the class. `` .hidden`, essential for the correct functioning of the toggle on the menu together with __proted_item_33_7C52511724274652BF3E697A154F2605__.

The style sheet includes the color of __proted_item_41_07db0ed35a584d5b35ed380ca679f28_ for the heading of the menu and a test font (which can be removed without problems to avoid conflicts).

__Protcted_item_34_9E03F0A983744A3788B9E930DED1F176_ The size of the map is not managed in the style sheet, but is defined directly in the HTML file for practicality.

### individual HTML files of libraries

The HTML files for each library are very simple. They import bookcases and style sheets of __proted_item_49_94752fc416554f8fa29264280B053DE9___, therefore populate the content of the HTML via the __proted_item_TEM_28B63A6Ded81495C09997E4__.

All the elements in the drop -down menu are generated by the __proted_item_36_8763A4F281DD4526BC11057462ed56A0__ In addition, the menu and the map container are structured in a hierarchical way, so that they remain "attached" to each other.

## Further choices and useful information

- The routes were created using __protted_item_57_3A2E3162BD894FEA9SF5219A3C2279E_ of __proted_item_46_776A27AD8FE49819A4971D7C15C3056___. 
- The __proted_item_37_fb07A638419C43DB3007B7B70378F028A______The Personalized rules (such as Marker Rossi and paths with the color of __protted_item_42_C2513EC802B849A68DD30B065F77747D_).
- The bookstores are imported from the web, but it may be more efficient to download them locally on a Polytechnic server. Not being particularly expert in web development, I can't say which solution would be the best to optimize loading.

## Possible future developments to map the entire Polytechnic

In my opinion, there are two options to map the entire Polytechnic:

1. __Protted_item_38_9a149234DC14DD7B52998E67BECDEB6__: These could be added as personalized layers on __proted_item_43_C5BD596CA5874D5EA0FC3B5C0F3796E7 __Protted_item_51_892B21AE2E5D41919D85A5704Dbbc002__.
2 __Protted_item_45_E8C4662C0D744E079057FC5A60A2CD12__ to make it available on multiple devices.

Both options offer advantages and disadvantages. The choice to extract the data __protted_item_53_38fbaf0f608041cdad5873A4E53FFC7C_ and map the Polytechnic via code offers great modularity and ease in changing the position of the resources (for example, if the offices are moved, it is not necessary to request a new seedling, just change the code). On the other hand, implementing the map using seedlings offers greater visibility on access, such as stairs and lifts, and would allow you to insert resources in a detailed context.

Both solutions would allow you to map each plan and improve the reference of resources, both in terms of accessibility and support for external and internal users in the search for structures.

The combination of __protcted_item_52_73B94CE0A424BCAA6673726B7E58448__ and __proted_item_44_B6C1902578614A2A3BFD8E7B940CD733 supplies a solid framework for both solutions.
