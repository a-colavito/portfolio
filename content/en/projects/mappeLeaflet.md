# Map libraries

This project concerns the view of the maps of the libraries of __protted_item_55_7a4ef440dcbf4c38Addd0f2754DA94B6__, using the maps of __protted_item_13_194A7001ba24ECF855555556104460_ __ProtedTed_item_14_ee386f36a46a4135b64620621a04bbfc_.

## Project structure

The entire project is contained in the __protcted_item_15_643ae22d1b2649deb3c3c3b1f88A607400______ of __ Protected_item_56_D041A4D222AC640DCBA5C8C8B319AC9412A__. Within this folder, there are three other subcarters:

- __protcted_item_16_0BCB2D547DA843D49C11CD9DD6C0A4BD__
- __protcted_item_17_283686f6205940d89Addcf896a1a9481__
- __protcted_item_18_796C436527D3442D9170E228064D16A__

### folder __protcted_item_19_EEB2AF3C80841A5A31862E3CE506C8D__

This folder contains the subcartella __protted_item_20_C5A88F8F13C435C8C8B0A729BA1882440__, which in turn includes JS files with variables (named the file) to initialize the data __Protted_item_21_d63bb843e290481a9Addfcde24328da2__ relating to the routes. All data on points, polygons, resources and paths are extracted from these files.

### folder __protcted_item_22_94bf74f514b242d1a1a1a0f0ac6e6f3f86__

The __proted_item_23_c181d234764d4c111b196f6048CE560C3_____ The main features of this file include:

- __protcted_item_25_fceee1dc83d943eb86fb5df9b1fd978c_: a function that accepts parameters such as `cencoordinates`,` zoomlevel`, etc., to set the layers of __ProtedTed_item_47_98785AB4B4A647EAA573918AA9C34B95__ and determine how the library is represented on the map and in the drop -down menu.
- __protcted_item_26_A2Deccec459741f8a93a194186a0620_ to the map.
- __protedTed_item_27_52939B39674C4B682F2A983E87F6925__: allows you to toge the menu and initialize the routes, showing the information relating to the library.
- __protted_item_28_36C1B1B1B2BD344927A83516A90B692D7F__: extends the __proted_item_48_5CB5B2F5BDB94E8FBE8421C84C3B8D4____

The manufacturer function simplifies the initialization of the map, allowing you to insert customizations through parameters passed to the __proted_item_29_8236b2d1ff47d7A023166E48F33D33D333 This approach makes the HTML code more slender and facilitates the addition of new resources by simply recalling the script in the HTML file of the new resource.

### folder __protcted_item_30_D924C99EFC684A168E2C9C8BF8BA7B6D__

The __protcted_item_31_34734Ced7C5C47A9BCA3F563E15ECD7B__ Folder contains the __proted_item_32_F59B86B281CF460FB8F86DA58E8A1993____, which manages the aspect of the menu and implement the class `` .hidden`, essential for the correct functioning of the toggle on the menu together with __proted_item_33_493359cc43341e9a7316a12d8e3c61a__.

The style sheet includes the color of the __proted_item_41_42B3BD9937DB408697291C0755E6C96F_ for the heading of the menu and a test font (which can be removed without problems to avoid conflicts).

__Protted_item_34_DC690FC8AA824B3EAB8906420B095B9A__ The size of the map is not managed in the style sheet, but is defined directly in the HTML file for practicality.

### individual HTML files of libraries

The HTML files for each library are very simple. They import bookcases and style sheets of __protted_item_49_cb61c0294B004BC68BC68BE56F6B704EE78__, therefore they populate the content of the HTML via the __proted_item_TEM_D35_D35FBD84AB96497F053F0687E34B2___.

All the elements in the drop -down menu are generated by the __proted_item_36_51f51EC93FBB643D6BC08069FB20190E9___ In addition, the menu and the map container are structured in a hierarchical way, so that they remain "attached" to each other.

## Further choices and useful information

- The routes were created using __protted_item_57_49970B6765A54FA38FAF875148BD4836_ of __proted_item_46_1a719bdebec34f298c0a430619f81ed1___. 
- the __proted_item_37_c94600E8438F404C8E388C8CC8CC5CC547B6BC_ file was commented in a detailed way, since there are some situations in which it was necessary to force the behavior of __protted_item_50_68BF8E5283F7480D9BE98B26E0193A1B Overwritten personalized rules (such as red marker and paths with the color of __proted_item_42_b371daa341b64dd3AAA4526D23F1F4D8C_).
- The bookstores are imported from the web, but it may be more efficient to download them locally on a Polytechnic server. Not being particularly expert in web development, I can't say which solution would be the best to optimize loading.

## Possible future developments to map the entire Polytechnic

In my opinion, there are two options to map the entire Polytechnic:

1. __Protcted_item_38_059edf5689a14be3b041e7e0f4e2141c_: these could be added as personalized layers on __proted_item_43_dba050a926204604888980401f8b644da_ __Protted_item_51_8FB2DEC08E6D4706BB30E86E0B3cc8__.
2 __ProtedTed_item_45_1779d6f7110F4F2CBAA2B59130980B3C_ to make it available on multiple devices.

Both options offer advantages and disadvantages. The choice to extract the data __protedTed_item_53_109f6Feac736463db1a908f61c21795A_ and map the polythech through code offers great modularity and ease in changing the position of the resources (for example, if the offices are moved, it is not necessary to request a new seedling, just change the code). On the other hand, implementing the map using seedlings offers greater visibility on access, such as stairs and lifts, and would allow you to insert resources in a detailed context.

Both solutions would allow you to map each plan and improve the reference of resources, both in terms of accessibility and support for external and internal users in the search for structures.

The combination of __protcted_item_52_8868E5F274A34615BFA3D0A34E3814F_ and __proted_item_44_D8C5FEF378D4DC903FF95D895AF81__ supplies a solid framework for both solutions.
