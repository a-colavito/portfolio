# Map libraries

This project concerns the display of the university libraries maps, using the ** OpensreetMAP ** maps and the Javascript ** Leaflet ** library.

## Project structure

The entire project is contained in the ** Sbamappe ** folder, which includes the HTML files for the four maps of the University's libraries. Within this folder, there are three other subcarters:

- **dataset**
- **script**
- **Style**

### folder ** dataset **

This folder contains the Sottocaltella ** Paths **, which in turn includes JS files with variables (named identical to the file) to initialize the ** Geojson ** data relating to the routes. All data on points, polygons, resources and paths are extracted from these files.

### Folder ** Script **

The ** script ** folder contains a single file, ** Maplogic.js **, which manages the logic of the maps. The main features of this file include:

- ** Map manufacturer **: a function that accepts parameters such as `centurcoordintes`,` zoomlevel`, etc., to set the leflet layers and determine how the library is represented on the map and in the drop -down menu.
- ** Addition of personalized layer ** to the map.
- ** Management of the drop -down menu **: allows you to toge the menu and initialize the paths, showing the information relating to the library.
- ** Personalization of Leaflet ** functions: extends the Leaflet library with specific customizations.

The manufacturer function simplifies the initialization of the map, allowing you to insert customizations through parameters passed to the ** InitializeMap ** function. This approach makes the HTML code more slender and facilitates the addition of new resources by simply recalling the script in the HTML file of the new resource.

### Folder ** Style **

The ** Style ** folder contains the ** SWEX ** file, which manages the appearance of the map menu and implements the `` .hidden` class, essential for the correct functioning of the toggle on the menu together with ** Maplogic.js **.

The style sheet includes the color of the Polytechnic of Bari for the heading of the menu and a test font (which can be removed without problems to avoid conflicts).

** Note: ** The size of the map is not managed in the style sheet, but is defined directly in the HTML file for practicality.

### individual HTML files of libraries

The HTML files for each library are very simple. They import the bookcases and leaflet style sheets, therefore populate the content of the HTML through the ** InitializeMap ** function.

All the elements in the drop -down menu are generated by the ** InitializeMap ** function. In addition, the menu and the map container are structured in a hierarchical way, so that they remain "attached" to each other.

## Further choices and useful information

- The routes were created using Google Maps bees. 
- The ** Maplogic.js ** file was commented in detail, since there are some situations in which it was necessary to force Leaflet behavior to overwrite personalized rules (such as Marker Rossi and paths with the color of the Polytechnic of Bari).
- The bookstores are imported from the web, but it may be more efficient to download them locally on a Polytechnic server. Not being particularly expert in web development, I can't say which solution would be the best to optimize loading.

## Possible future developments to map the entire Polytechnic

In my opinion, there are two options to map the entire Polytechnic:

1. ** Use the CAD plans of the Polytechnic **: these could be added as personalized layers on Opensreetmap using Leaflet.
2. ** Extract the geojson data from the BefreeCampus ** application: make a porting of the app in the web key, possibly as Webapp or using solutions such as flutter / react native to make it available on multiple devices.

Both options offer advantages and disadvantages. The choice to extract the Geojson data and map the Polytechnic through code offers great modularity and ease in changing the position of the resources (for example, if the offices are moved, it is not necessary to request a new seedling, just change the code). On the other hand, implementing the map using seedlings offers greater visibility on access, such as stairs and lifts, and would allow you to insert resources in a detailed context.

Both solutions would allow you to map each plan and improve the reference of resources, both in terms of accessibility and support for external and internal users in the search for structures.

The combination of Leaflet and Opensreetmap provides a solid framework for both solutions.
