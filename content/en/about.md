I am Adolfo, IT engineer __html_tag_0 ____ HTML_TAG_1__Wannabe. </em> </a>
On this site you will find my projects, the books I read and the films seen recently.  
Not only therefore a portfolio site but a hybrid space where you can understand what I like to do in the various contexts that occupy my life: working, cultural, sporting (the latter section will come soon).  
The site is simple and essential, without unnecessary complications, modular and easily updated, all thanks to an efficient mix of __html_tag_2__hugo & Papermod </a>.
For any curiosity, project proposal or exchange of ideas, do not exist at __html_tag_3___contract me! </a> (I swear I also read the spam folder)
