# Map libraries

This project concerns the view of the maps of the University libraries, using the maps of **__ Term_4 __** and the __term_7___ **__ Term_12 __** library.

## Project structure

The entire project is contained in the **Sbamappe** folder, which includes __mate_27__ files for the four maps of the University. Within this folder, there are three other subcarters:

- **dataset**
- **script**
- **__ Term_24 __**

### folder **dataset**

This folder contains the Sottocaltella **Paths**, which in turn includes the __term_34___ files with the variables (named identical to the file) to initialize the data **__ Term_20 __** relating to the routes. All data on points, polygons, resources and paths are extracted from these files.

### Folder **Script**

The **script** folder contains a single file, **Maplogic.js**, which manages the logic of the maps. The main features of this file include:

- **Map builder**: a function that accepts parameters such as `centurcoordintes`,` zoomlevel`, etc., to set the layers of __term_13__ and determine how the library is represented on the map and in the drop -down menu.
- **Addition of personalized layer** to the map.
- **Management of the drop -down menu**: allows you to toge the menu and initialize the paths, showing the information relating to the library.
- **Personalization of the functions of __term_14 __**: extends the __term_15__ Library with specific customizations.

The __term_0__ simplifies the initialization of the map, allowing you to insert customizations through parameters passed to the **InitializeMap** function. This approach makes the code __term_28___ more slender and facilitates the addition of new resources simply by recalling the __mate_23__ in the __mate_29__ file of the new resource.

### folder **__ Term_25 __**

The folder **__ Term_26 __** contains the **SWEX** file, which manages the appearance of the map menu and implements the ``.hidden` class, essential for the correct functioning of the toggle of the menu together with **Maplic.js**.

The style sheet includes the color of the __term_1__ for the heading of the menu and a test font (which can be removed without problems to avoid conflicts).

**NOTE:** The size of the map is not managed in the style sheet, but is defined directly in the __term_30__ file for practicality.

### individual files __term_31__ of libraries

The __term_32__ files for each library are very simple. They import the __term_8__ and the style sheets of __term_16___, then populate the content of __ Term_33__ through the **InitializeMAP** function.

All the elements in the drop -down menu are generated by the **InitializeMap** function. In addition, the menu and the map container are structured in a hierarchical way, so that they remain "attached" to each other.

## Further choices and useful information

- The routes were created using __term_3__. 
- The **Maplogic.js** file was commented in detail, since there are some situations in which it was necessary to force the behavior of __term_17__ to overwrite personalized rules (such as red marker and paths with the color of __term_2___).
- The __term_9__ are imported from the web, but it could be more efficient to download them locally on a Polytechnic server. Not being particularly expert in web development, I can't say which solution would be the best to optimize loading.

## Possible future developments to map the entire Polytechnic

In my opinion, there are two options to map the entire Polytechnic:

1. **Use the __term_10__ CAD of the Polytechnic**: these could be added as personalized layers on __term_5__ using __term_18__.
2. **Extract the data __term_21__ from the BefreeCampus** application: make a porting of the app in the web key, possibly as Webapp or using solutions such as flutter / react native to make it available on multiple devices.

Both options offer advantages and disadvantages. The choice to extract the data __term_22__ and map the Polytechnic via code offers great modularity and ease in changing the position of the resources (for example, if the offices are moved, it is not necessary to request a new seedling, just change the code). On the other hand, implementing the map using the __term_11___ offers greater visibility on access, such as stairs and lifts, and would allow you to insert resources in a detailed context.

Both solutions would allow you to map each plan and improve the reference of resources, both in terms of accessibility and support for external and internal users in the search for structures.

The combination of __term_19__ and __term_6__ supplies a solid framework for both solutions.
