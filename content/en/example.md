# Bookstore Map

This project concerns the display of the **__ Term_14__ of the University** maps, using the maps **__ Term_5 __** and the __term_12___ **__ Term_20 __** library.

## Project structure

The entire project is contained in the folder **__ Term_13 __**, which includes files __term_40__ for the four maps of the university libraries. Within this folder, there are three other subcarters:

- **__ Term_31 __**
- **__ Term_33 __**
- **__ Term_37 __**

### folder **__ Term_32 __**

This folder contains the subcartella **Paths**, which in turn includes __term_48___ files with variables (appointed identical to the file) to initialize the data **__ Term_28 __** relating to the routes. All data on points, polygons, resources and paths are extracted from these files.

### folder **__ Term_34 __**

The folder **__ Term_35 __** contains a single file, **__ Term_9 __**, which manages the logic of the maps. The main features of this file include:

- **Map builder function**: a function that accepts parameters such as `cencoordinates`,` zoomlevel`, etc., to set the layers of __term_21__ and determine how the library is represented on the map and in the drop -down menu.
- **Addition of personalized layer** to the map.
- **Management of the drop -down menu**: allows **__ Term_4 __** and initialize the paths, showing the information relating to the library.
- **Personalization of the** functions of __term_22___: extends the __term_23______ with specific customizations.

The __term_0__ simplifies the initialization of the map, allowing you to insert customizations through parameters passed to the **InitializeMap** function. This approach makes the code __term_41___ more streamlined and facilitates the addition of new resources by simply recalling the __mate_36__ in the __term_42__ file of the new resource.

### folder **__ Term_38 __**

The folder **__ Term_39 __** contains the **__ Term_47 _47 file, which manages the appearance of the map menu and implements the ``.hidden` class, essential for the correct functioning of the toggle on the menu together with** __ Term_10 __ **.

The style sheet includes the color of the **__ Term_1 __** for the heading of the menu and a test font (which can be removed without problems to avoid conflicts).

**Note:** The size of the map is not managed in the style sheet, but is defined directly in the __term_43__ file for practicality.

### Files __term_44__ individuals of __term_15__

The __term_45__ files for each library are very simple. They import the __term_16__ and the style sheets of __term_24__, therefore populate the content of __ Term_46__ through the **InitializeMAP** function.

All elements in the drop -down menu are generated by the **InitializeMap** function. In addition, the menu and the map container are structured in a hierarchical way, so that they remain "attached" to each other.

## Further choices and useful information

- The routes were created using the **__ Term_3 __**.
- The **__ Term_11 __** file was commented in detail, since there are some situations in which it was necessary to force the behavior of __term_25__ to overwrite personalized rules (such as Marker Rossi and paths with the color of the **__ Term_2 __**).
- The __term_17__ are imported from the web, but it may be more efficient to download them locally on a Polytechnic server. Not being particularly expert in web development, I cannot say which solution would be the best to optimize loading.

## Possible future developments to map the entire Polytechnic

In my opinion, there are two options to map the entire Polytechnic:

1. **Use the __term_18___ CAD of the Polytechnic**: these could be added as personalized layers on __term_6__ using __mate_26__.
2. **Extract the data __mate_29__ from the application __term_8 __**: make a porting of the app in the web key, possibly as webapp or using solutions such as flutter/react native to make it available on multiple devices.

Both options offer advantages and disadvantages. The choice to extract the __30____ and map the Polytechnic via code offers great modularity and ease in changing the position of the resources (for example, if the offices are moved, it is not necessary to request a new seedling, just change the code). On the other hand, implementing the map using __term_19___ offers greater visibility on access, such as stairs and lifts, and would allow you to insert resources in a detailed context.

Both solutions would allow you to map every plan and improve the reference of resources, both in terms of accessibility and support to external and internal users in the search for structures.

The combination of __term_27__ and __term_7___s provides a solid framework for both solutions.
