All data on points, polygons, resources, and paths are extracted from these files.\nScript Folder The Script folder contains a single file, MapLogic.js, which handles the map logic. The main functionalities of this file include:\nMap constructor: a function that takes parameters such as centerCoordinates, zoomLevel, etc., to set up Leaflet layers and determine how the library is represented on the map and in the dropdown menu. Adding custom layers to the map. Dropdown menu management: allows toggling the menu and initializing the paths, displaying information related to the library. Leaflet function customization: extends the Leaflet library with specific customizations. The constructor function simplifies the initialization of the map, allowing customization through parameters passed to the initializeMap function.

Inside this folder, there are three subfolders:\nDataset Script Style Dataset Folder This folder contains the Percorsi subfolder, which in turn includes JS files with variables (named identically to the file) to initialize GeoJSON data for the paths. All data on points, polygons, resources, and paths are extracted from these files.\nScript Folder The Script folder contains a single file, MapLogic.js, which handles the map logic. The main functionalities of this file include:\nMap constructor: a function that takes parameters such as centerCoordinates, zoomLevel, etc., to set up Leaflet layers and determine how the library is represented on the map and in the dropdown menu. Adding custom layers to the map. Dropdown menu management: allows toggling the menu and initializing the paths, displaying information related to the library. Leaflet function customization: extends the Leaflet library with specific customizations. The constructor function simplifies the initialization of the map, allowing customization through parameters passed to the initializeMap function. This approach makes the HTML code cleaner and facilitates the addition of new resources simply by calling the script in the HTML file of the new resource.\nStyle Folder The Style folder contains the SBACSS file, which handles the appearance of the map menu and implements the .hidden class, essential for the toggle functionality to work correctly alongside MapLogic.js.\nThe stylesheet includes Politecnico di Bari’s brand color for the menu header and a test font (which can be safely removed to avoid conflicts).\nNote: The map size is not managed in the stylesheet but is instead defined directly in the HTML file for convenience.\nIndividual Library HTML Files The HTML files for each library are very simple. They import Leaflet libraries and stylesheets and then populate the HTML content through the initializeMap function.\nAll elements in the dropdown menu are generated by the initializeMap function. Moreover, the menu and the map container are hierarchically structured so they stay “attached” to each other.\nAdditional Choices and Useful Information The paths were created using the Google Maps API. The MapLogic.js file is thoroughly commented, as there are some situations where Leaflet’s behavior had to be overridden to apply custom rules (e.g., red markers and paths using the Politecnico di Bari color). Libraries are imported from the web, but it might be more efficient to download them locally onto a university server. Not being particularly experienced in web development, I can\u0026rsquo;t say which solution would be best to optimize loading. Possible Future Developments for Mapping the Entire Politecnico In my opinion, there are two options for mapping the entire university:\nUse the Politecnico’s CAD blueprints: these could be added as custom layers on OpenStreetMap using Leaflet. Extract GeoJSON data from the BeFreeCampus app: port the app to the web, potentially as a WebApp or using solutions like Flutter / React Native to make it available on multiple devices. Both options offer pros and cons. Extracting GeoJSON data and mapping the university via code provides great modularity and ease in modifying resource locations (e.g., if offices are moved, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to request a new blueprint—just update the code). On the other hand, implementing the map using the blueprints provides greater visibility on access points such as stairs and elevators and allows embedding resources in a detailed context.\nBoth solutions would enable mapping of each floor and improve the referencing of resources, both in terms of accessibility and support for external and internal users in locating facilities.\nThe combination of Leaflet and OpenStreetMap provides a solid framework for both solutions.\nContact For any information requests, Send me an email.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/portfolio/en/projects/leafletmap/","summary":"\u003cimg src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkkvkj82k/image/upload/v1749552452/Screenshot_2025-06-10_alle_12.46.47_hqonwp.png\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 30%\" \u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mappegeneral.netlify.app\"\u003e You can use the app here \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mapping-the-libraries\"\u003eMapping the Libraries\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project focuses on visualizing the university library maps using \u003cstrong\u003eOpenStreetMap\u003c/strong\u003e and the JavaScript library \u003cstrong\u003eLeaflet\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"project-structure\"\u003eProject Structure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire project is contained in the \u003cstrong\u003eSBAMappe\u003c/strong\u003e folder, which includes the HTML files for the four university library maps.
