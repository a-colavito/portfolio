I'm Adolfo, a computer engineer <a href="/esami/" style ="text-decoration: none"><mark><em>wannabe.</em></mark> </a>
On this site you'll find my projects, the books I read, and the movies I've recently watched.
So, not just a portfolio site but a hybrid space where you can understand what I like to do in the various contexts that occupy my life: work, culture, sports (this last section will arrive soon).
The site is simple and essential, without unnecessary complications, modular, and easily updatable, all thanks to an efficient mix of <a href="/progetti/aboutsite" style ="color: #282c30;"><b>Hugo & Papermod</b></a>.
For any curiosity, project proposal, or exchange of ideas, don't hesitate to <a href="/en/contacts" style="color: #282c30; "> contact me!</a>  (I swear I even check the spam folder)"
