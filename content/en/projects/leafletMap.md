# Mapping the Libraries

This project focuses on visualizing the university library maps using **OpenStreetMap** and the JavaScript library **Leaflet**.

## Project Structure

The entire project is contained in the **SBAMappe** folder, which includes the HTML files for the four university library maps. Inside this folder, there are three subfolders:

- **Dataset**
- **Script**
- **Style**

### **Dataset** Folder

This folder contains the **Percorsi** subfolder, which in turn includes JS files with variables (named identically to the file) to initialize **GeoJSON** data for the paths. All data on points, polygons, resources, and paths are extracted from these files.

### **Script** Folder

The **Script** folder contains a single file, **MapLogic.js**, which handles the map logic. The main functionalities of this file include:

- **Map constructor**: a function that takes parameters such as `centerCoordinates`, `zoomLevel`, etc., to set up Leaflet layers and determine how the library is represented on the map and in the dropdown menu.
- **Adding custom layers** to the map.
- **Dropdown menu management**: allows toggling the menu and initializing the paths, displaying information related to the library.
- **Leaflet function customization**: extends the Leaflet library with specific customizations.

The constructor function simplifies the initialization of the map, allowing customization through parameters passed to the **initializeMap** function. This approach makes the HTML code cleaner and facilitates the addition of new resources simply by calling the script in the HTML file of the new resource.

### **Style** Folder

The **Style** folder contains the **SBACSS** file, which handles the appearance of the map menu and implements the `.hidden` class, essential for the toggle functionality to work correctly alongside **MapLogic.js**.

The stylesheet includes Politecnico di Bari’s brand color for the menu header and a test font (which can be safely removed to avoid conflicts).

**Note:** The map size is not managed in the stylesheet but is instead defined directly in the HTML file for convenience.

### Individual Library HTML Files

The HTML files for each library are very simple. They import Leaflet libraries and stylesheets and then populate the HTML content through the **initializeMap** function.

All elements in the dropdown menu are generated by the **initializeMap** function. Moreover, the menu and the map container are hierarchically structured so they stay “attached” to each other.

## Additional Choices and Useful Information

- The paths were created using the Google Maps API.  
- The **MapLogic.js** file is thoroughly commented, as there are some situations where Leaflet’s behavior had to be overridden to apply custom rules (e.g., red markers and paths using the Politecnico di Bari color).
- Libraries are imported from the web, but it might be more efficient to download them locally onto a university server. Not being particularly experienced in web development, I can't say which solution would be best to optimize loading.

## Possible Future Developments for Mapping the Entire Politecnico

In my opinion, there are two options for mapping the entire university:

1. **Use the Politecnico’s CAD blueprints**: these could be added as custom layers on OpenStreetMap using Leaflet.  
2. **Extract GeoJSON data from the BeFreeCampus app**: port the app to the web, potentially as a WebApp or using solutions like Flutter / React Native to make it available on multiple devices.

Both options offer pros and cons. Extracting GeoJSON data and mapping the university via code provides great modularity and ease in modifying resource locations (e.g., if offices are moved, there's no need to request a new blueprint—just update the code). On the other hand, implementing the map using the blueprints provides greater visibility on access points such as stairs and elevators and allows embedding resources in a detailed context.

Both solutions would enable mapping of each floor and improve the referencing of resources, both in terms of accessibility and support for external and internal users in locating facilities.

The combination of Leaflet and OpenStreetMap provides a solid framework for both solutions.
